                            This project focused on the use of off-the-shelf hardware to test the security of UAVs. I used a simple software defined radio (SDR) with a crystal oscillator (for ppm accuracy) and ran open-source software on the device. This was used offensively against a civilian UAV in a controlled environment. The research project proved our ability to send out fake GPS signals to the drone and the mobile device controlling it.

                            In my Microprocessor Control Board project, I soldered and assembled a microprocessor onto a custom control board. This board served as the foundation for a versatile I/O device. I soldered buttons and joysticks onto the board, where it acted as a functional game controller, I/O device, and even a computer mouse. To breathe life into this creation, I wrote a series of programs in both assembly and C code. These programs not only demonstrated the versatility of the control board but also showcased my proficiency in microprocessor programming.
